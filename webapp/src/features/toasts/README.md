# features/toasts <!-- omit in toc -->

Heavily inspired by [jukanntenn / react-bootstrap-toasts](https://github.com/jukanntenn/react-bootstrap-toasts/tree/main), this feature provides a really simple way to render and manage toasts in the application. Initially designed using Bootstrap, they were later adapted to Tailwind CSS.
